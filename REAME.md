# Gentoo LXD image builder

A collection of scripts to help build Gentoo LXD images.

This project is not endorsed by Gentoo. It is only a personal exercise with LXD to containerize services in a more
manageable way than raw LXC and without resorting to using Docker. This project is using the deprecated
[LXC templates](https://github.com/lxc/lxc-templates).
